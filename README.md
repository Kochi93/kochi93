### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michael KochendÃ¶rfer.

I am learning Symfony as requirement to learn Shopware 6 Backend Development.
So I have to learn VueJs and after that I create a small module for Shopware 6 Backend.
Finished UdemyCourse for Vue.JS by Ruven Martin. https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-e4831f27-22c4-4d38-aa2c-0d92bc882c9d/
Any suggestions? 

After finishing the module development for shopware 6 Backend I learn Shopware 6 Frontend.

If there is any plenty time in this year i am going to learn Laravel by passing through an Udemy Course.
